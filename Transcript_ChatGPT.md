Rockwell Automation's history traces back to 1903 when it was originally founded as the Compression Rheostat Company in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, by Lynde Bradley and Dr. Stanton Allen. This marked the beginning of a company that would later become a leader in industrial automation.

Key Milestones of Rockwell Automation's Early History:
1903: Lynde Bradley and Stanton Allen founded the Compression Rheostat Company with an initial investment of $1,000. The company focused on producing rheostats (devices that adjust electrical resistance), which were important in controlling the speed of electric motors.

1904: The company introduced its first product, a carbon disc compression-type motor controller. This was significant because it provided a way to control motor speeds, which was essential for machinery in various industries.

1910: The company was renamed to Allen-Bradley Company, combining the founders' last names. Under this name, the company expanded its focus to producing industrial automation equipment, including motor controllers and other industrial devices.

Rockwell Automation’s roots in 1903 laid the groundwork for the company's future growth, and it continued to expand and evolve through the 20th century. By focusing on electrical control and automation, Allen-Bradley became a pioneer in the development of industrial solutions, which eventually led to the formation of the larger Rockwell Automation entity as we know it today.
