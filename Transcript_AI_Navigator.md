Rockwell Automation is indeed utilizing AI in their software solutions, including for the automotive industry. One example is their AI-driven adaptive control system, which helps maintain optimal performance in manufacturing processes. By using AI to identify causal relationships, predict process results, and prescribe optimal actions to the automation controller, Rockwell Automation helps automotive manufacturers improve system performance and reduce out-of-tolerance events by up to 50%. This ultimately enhances plant capacity to meet increasing demand.

Another application of AI in the automotive industry is the implementation of Vision AI at the edge for quality inspection and closed-loop quality control. Rockwell Automation enables manufacturers to move from human-based anomaly detection to an automated system using vision sensing systems. By deploying AI-enabled vision systems at the edge, automotive manufacturers can continuously monitor product variances and recommend changes to equipment settings. This results in improved quality inspection cycle time by 50-75%, increased accuracy of inspection, and enhanced labor productivity.

These are just a few examples of how Rockwell Automation is leveraging AI in their software solutions to drive improvements in the automotive industry. For more detailed information and specific use cases, I recommend visiting the Rockwell Automation website or reaching out to their sales team.
