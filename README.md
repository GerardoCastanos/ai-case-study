## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming more popular due to its ability to analyze enormous amounts of data and help with complex tasks. This has been recognized for example in academic circles, such as the Nobel committee, which recently awarded machine learning two prizes for its advancements in physics and chemistry. HoweverAI is becoming a breakthrough technology not only in academic circles but also in a wide variety of industries that need better ways to analyze data such as the manufacturing industry.

The manufacturing industry, commonly known for constantly pursuing new technological advantages in its continuous pursuit of efficiency and quality, is undergoing significant changes to implement AI in manufacturing operations to improve efficiency and profitability.In this field, a blog published by Microsoft in 2024 details that *"the manufacturing sector is not just a prospect, it is an unfolding reality. 77% of surveyed firms with more than USD10 billion in annual revenue are already deploying AI use cases."* (Parag Ladha, 2024). 

This interest in AI gives a clear idea of the potential growth that AI will provide for the manufacturing industry and the high attention that is receiving by big companies for the potential to improve growth.

## **Rockwell Automation**

**Rockwell Automation** is one of the companies that has been a key player in industrial automation and digital transformation for the manufacturing industry since its foundation in 1903 by Dr. Stanton Allen and Lynde Bradley under the name *"The Allen-Bradley Company"* with the invention of the compression rheostat, a device used to control the speed of electric motors better.

The company gained prominence in the 1960s for its pivotal role in popularizing Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) and in 2001, **Rockwell Automation** became a separate entity after Rockwell International, which owned Allen-Bradley, demerged to diversify its business operations and more recently in 2023, **Rockwell Automation** announced a collaboration with Microsoft to develop *"digital solutions for manufacturers."* 

In a blog published in 2023, Rockwell and Microsoft detail their direction to *"improve the efficiency of manufacturing processes through digital innovation"* while focusing on bridging the gap between Informational Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT). (Kam VedBrat, 2023).

**Rockwell Automation** maintains a strong presence in the industrial automation sector, with an estimated revenue of $9.06 billion. However, it remains minor compared to major competitors like Honeywell International, which has an estimated revenue of $36.6 billion; Siemens AG, $81.8 billion; and Schneider Electric, $38.8 billion.

## AI in Manufacturing

Increasingly, the manufacturing industries are seeing the introduction of IA in their processes, not necessarily to replace the humans on the plant floors but to generate an environment where humans and robots can collaborate with the help of many sensors that constantly measure the different stages of the manufacturing flow.

Machines are becoming more integrated with the manufacturing environment, the supply chain, and other business aspects. By streamlining data processing, the expectation is that the people who maintain the processes can spend less time keeping the environment running and more time working on continuous improvement and innovation. Notably the factory maintenance would benefit by implementing preventive solutions that would proactively minimize unplanned disruptions and maximize operation efficiency.

Companies like **Rockwell Automation** are looking towards integrating machine learning with process control to predict future behaviors at high speeds to improve quality, increase machine utilization, and increase profit. FactoryTalk® Design Studio uses machine learning mainly using Microsoft Azure's open AI service to help manufacturers integrate their operations with Open AI models that Rockwell says will *"empower experienced engineers to accelerate development and guide newcomers along a more efficient and effective learning path."* (John Waters, 2023)

FactoryTalk by **Rockwell Automation** primarily utilizes Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Service, which incorporates large language models (LLMs) like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer). These models are part of the Azure cloud platform. They are used within FactoryTalk® Design Studio to assist engineers by enabling natural language code generation, automating tasks, and improving overall design efficiency. Azure's generative AI capabilities extend to chatbots and quality management solutions, leveraging the same foundational models.

Other companies, such as Siemens, GE, and NVIDIA, are following similar trends as Rockwell by using cloud solutions and AI capabilities like IBM Watson to allow manufacturers to mitigate risks and improve safety and efficiency. Different tools are used in various ways around the manufacturing environment, such as predictive maintenance and risk prevention, making the market for AI solutions highly competitive.

## Recommendations

During this research, finding a clear distinction on where **Rockwell Automation** should improve its business model was complicated. The lack of such distinction poses a risk in terms of market capitalization. **Rockwell Automation** needs to demonstrate better the capabilities of the solution that they are proposing to the industries they are targettin. Besides the press release of their partnership with Microsoft and the use of Azure, there is, at least for the scope of this research, nothing that would position them as pioneers in the AI manufacturing automation field.

Rockwell should advertise their solutions in-depth and diversify more in areas with intense competition, like preventive maintenance software that uses Machine Learning and AI and their Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES). Currently, the advertising for the technology does not necessarily reflect directly the benefits nor the value that its solutions can offer to new companies, and with companies that have more presence in the market, like SAP, Siemens, and Honeywell that offer similar solutions, the execution of Rockwell's FactoryTalk® might not seem appealing in this growing environment.

Nevertheless **Rockwell Automation** has done an outstanding job positioning themselves within the automotive industry. According to the *"**Rockwell Automation**: State of Smart Manufacturing Report: Automotive Edition,"* in 2024, as many as 97% of the companies involved in the research are considering *"using or evaluating smart manufacturing technology,"* with 42% of the technological investment dedicated to Generative or Causal AI. These figures highlight a promising future for AI in the manufacturing industry. With its continuous growth **Rockwell Automation** can secure a significant role in the industrial automation market by intelligently using its partnership with Microsoft and demonstrating to the industry that they are indeed *"the world's largest company dedicated to industrial automation and digital transformation."* (Rockwell et al., 2023)
