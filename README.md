## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming more popular due to its ability to analyze enormous amounts of data and help with complex tasks. 

This importance has been recognized in academic circles, such as the Nobel committee, which recently awarded machine learning two prizes for its physics and chemistry advancements. However, not only in academic circles is AI becoming a breakthrough technology; in this global technological environment, only some industries will resist this trend.

One of these industries is manufacturing, commonly known for constantly pursuing new technological advantages in its continuous pursuit of efficiency and quality. 

In this field, a blog published by Microsoft in 2024 details that "the manufacturing sector is not just a prospect, it's an unfolding reality. 77% of surveyed firms with more than USD10 billion in annual revenue are already deploying AI use cases." (Parag Ladha, 2024). 

This interest in AI gives a clear idea of the potential growth that AI will provide for the manufacturing industry.

## Rockwell Automation

Rockwell Automation is one of the companies that has been a key player in industrial automation and digital transformation for the manufacturing industry since its foundation in 1903 by Dr. Stanton Allen and Lynde Bradley under the name "The Allen-Bradley Company," with the invention of the compression rheostat, a device used to control the speed of electric motors better. 
The company gained prominence in the 1960s for its pivotal role in popularizing Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). In 2001, Rockwell Automation became a separate entity after Rockwell International, which owned Allen-Bradley, demerged to diversify its business operations. 
In 2023, Rockwell Automation announced a collaboration with Microsoft to develop "digital solutions for manufacturers." In a blog published in 2023, Rockwell and Microsoft detail their direction to "improve the efficiency of manufacturing processes through digital innovation" while focusing on bridging the gap between Informational Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT). (Kam VedBrat, 2023).

Rockwell Automation maintains a strong presence in the industrial automation sector, with an estimated revenue of $9.06 billion. However, it remains minor compared to major competitors like Honeywell International, which has an estimated revenue of $36.6 billion; Siemens AG, $81.8 billion; and Schneider Electric, $38.8 billion.
